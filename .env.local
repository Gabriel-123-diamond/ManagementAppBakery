# == FIREBASE EMULATOR / GOOGLE CLOUD SERVICE ACCOUNT CREDENTIALS ==
# =================================================================
#
# When running Genkit with the Firebase plugin against the local emulators
# (via `genkit start`), Genkit will automatically use the emulators.
#
# In a deployed environment (e.g., Cloud Run), credentials are usually
# automatically configured.
#
# For local development against live Firebase services, you can use
# `gcloud auth application-default login` to set up credentials.
#
# Alternatively, you can explicitly point to a service account key file
# by uncommenting and setting the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS variable.
#
# GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/your/service-account-key.json"

#
# These variables are prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC_ so they are available
# to the browser-side code for Firebase initialization.
#
# Replace these with your actual Firebase project configuration values.
# You can find these in your Firebase project settings.
